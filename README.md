# NerualNetwork0
# Part 1 - XOR
# Using the XOR dataset below, train (400 epochs) a neural network (NN) using 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hidden layers (where each layer has only 2 neurons). For each n layers, store the resulting loss score along with n. Plot the results to find what the optimal number of layers is.
# Repeat the above with 3 neurons in each Hidden layers. How do these results compare to the 2 neuron layers?
# Repeat the above with 4 neurons in each Hidden layers. How do these results compare to the 2 and 3 neuron layers?
# Using the most optimal configuraion (n-layers, k-neurons per layer), compare how tanh, sigmoid,softplus and relu effect the loss after 400 epochs. Try other Activation functions as well (https://keras.io/activations/)
# Again with the most optimal setup, try other optimizers (instead of SGD) and report on the loss score. (https://keras.io/optimizers/)
# Part 2 - BYOD
